### Purpose of this repository

Many developers ask me how would I implement a certain feature in their projects, using Clean Architecture. Instead of telling them how to implement, now I'll create a piece of code and add in this repository, to be a real-life example.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Authentication
    - [ ] with email and password
    - [ ] with Google
    - [ ] with Facebook

More implementations in a near future
